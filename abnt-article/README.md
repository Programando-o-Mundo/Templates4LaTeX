# ABNT article

This is a template for an ABNT article, using as base the ![abntex2](https://github.com/abntex/abntex2) document class. This class already helps with setting up a base project, with only some minor
issues, that I took the liberty to make my own fixes in the code.

If you want to know more about the abntex2, ![click here](https://github.com/abntex/abntex2/wiki) to access their wiki, which contains a documentation on how
everything works.
