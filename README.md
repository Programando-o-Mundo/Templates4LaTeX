A repository for storing templates for LaTeX projects

The idea for this came about when I was discussing with friends about creating a repository if pre-made LaTeX projects templates, to minimize the necessity of having to create projects from scratch.

I decided to add my own templates, but feel free to add issues/pull requests about other templates.

## Current templates

* Article
  * ABNT
  * SBC
  * IEEE
* Homework
  * Template1
