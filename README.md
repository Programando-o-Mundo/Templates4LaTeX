A repository for storing templates for LaTeX projects

Stored in this repository are pre-made LaTeX templates for creating all sorts of projects, from article, thesis, homework, slides
and more.

I decided to add my own templates, but feel free to add issues/pull requests about other templates.

## Current templates

* Article
  * ABNT
  * SBC
  * IEEE
* Homework
  * Template1
