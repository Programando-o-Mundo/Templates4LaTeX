# SBC Article

This is a template for SBC Article, based on ![this template on Overleaf](https://pt.overleaf.com/latex/templates/sbc-conferences-template/blbxwjwzdngr), the main
difference is that the **sbc-template.sty** is the most recent from SBC's website, with an update to subsubsection spacing. I also implemented the use of import, for
better organization of the project.
